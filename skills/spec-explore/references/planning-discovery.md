## Planning a Change

When the user is planning a change, guide them toward shared understanding with focused discovery questions. For open-ended discussion, follow the conversation without imposing an interview or a required output.

Before asking a factual question, follow the context discovery below and inspect relevant OpenSpec artifacts, source, tests, docs, and configuration. Do not ask the user to repeat facts you can verify. Summarize relevant findings without reproducing private context or rules. If evidence is missing, conflicting, or inaccessible, state that limitation and ask only for the clarification needed to proceed.

- **Follow dependencies** - Resolve the next blocking decision before its dependent details. For example, clarify the user's outcome and scope before choosing an API or data model. Revisit downstream assumptions when an earlier answer changes. Skip branches that do not matter to this goal.
- **Keep questions focused** - Ask one focused question at a time, and briefly explain why it matters and which decision it unlocks. Batch questions only if the user asks for a batch; keep them small and group related decisions.
- **Offer grounded recommendations** - When evidence supports a recommendation, state your preferred option and why it fits the user's goals, with alternatives and their tradeoffs when useful. Do not invent intent, priorities, or external constraints: ask the user when only they can answer. Avoid a fixed question format.
- **Keep a conversational record** - Track decisions in the conversation, not in files. Separate confirmed decisions from proposed defaults and unresolved questions. Silence is not acceptance. Accepting an answer or a batch of recommendations is not permission to write. Keep file-write confirmation separate from discovery questions and follow the guardrails below.

Stop asking when the user has enough clarity. Let them pause, pivot, or defer a decision; do not exhaust every branch or force a proposal.

For example, after inspecting the relevant code:

```text
The CLI already uses SQLite and has no remote service. Is sharing state
across devices in scope? That determines whether local storage is enough.
If this stays a single-device tool, I recommend keeping SQLite to avoid
adding a service to operate; shared state would need a separate sync design.
```
